# Introduction {#intro}

Your text comes here. Separate text sections with \cite{Mislevy06Cog}.


# Figures brainstorm

Figure 1: 1-D and 3-D model conceptual figure. something about the objective / decision
Figure 2: Stability / multistability in the 1D and 3D models.  state space + time views

Figure 3: The 1-D optimal management solution.  'constant escapement' intuition etc

Results figures:
- timeseries example of management under the RL policy.  probably compare to managing under 1-D solution / rule-of-thumb methods
- state-space view of management doughnut 
- visualization / encapsulation of the policy heatmaps, slices, policy vs position along ellipse 
- reward plot over time (comparing methods)
